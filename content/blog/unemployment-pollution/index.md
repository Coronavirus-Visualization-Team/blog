On March 26, 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) temporarily relaxed the enforcement of environmental regulations, citing that the coronavirus pandemic would constrain the ability to perform testing. Facilities now only have to keep records of noncompliance, but do not need to require any public disclosures or report to the EPA. The EPA claims that rolling back environmental regulations will not negatively impact the environment and will bolster the economic viability of fossil fuel industries. As part of conducting research into the viability of the EPA’s claims, a group of CVT members explored the changing pollution levels in California since the EPA’s rollbacks and how they relate to other economic factors. 

In the process of completing this data visualization, Emily Chang, the project lead, and Ellie Klibaner-Schiff researched pollution trends in California while Kenneth Zhang gathered unemployment claim data. Under the mentorship of Dr. Joni Seager, Professor of Global Studies at Bentley University and feminist geographer, the team plotted changes in statewide pollution and changes in statewide unemployment, exposing a clear correlation: as the number of unemployment claims increased, pollution decreased. Pollution data was collected from the EPA Air Monitoring Network, and unemployment data was collected from the United States Department of Labor and the California Employment Department. 

The measure of pollution focused on in this research, particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), is an extremely sensitive pollutant. There is little lag time between changes in the production of PM 2.5 and measured changes in observed PM 2.5. “The sensitivity of PM 2.5 makes it a really great pollutant to compare with other data. Since PM 2.5 levels essentially reflect current pollutant production, we can clearly see how current economic factors, such as unemployment, line up with pollution,” Klibaner-Schiff said.

The unemployment and pollution graphs show a strikingly clear correlation between an increase in unemployment claims and a decrease in pollution levels in California. By linking environmental and economic data, the effects of the EPA’s regulations, and the viability of the EPA’s claims, can be examined further to reach important conclusions.

“The graph shows that unemployment can be our stand-in for economic activity as it correlates well with pollution levels in May. Establishing this relationship sets us up for writing functions that correlate economic activity for each city in California directly with pollution levels,” Chang said about this visualization and the next steps it may lead to.
