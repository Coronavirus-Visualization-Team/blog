# CVT Blog
This is the official blog website for CVT! This is worked on by the members of the website team of CVT.

## Important links
- GitHub respository: https://github.com/Coronavirus-Visualization-Team/blog
- Currently deployed website: https://blog.understandcovid.org/

## Current members
- Steve (Executive)
- Calix (Lead, Lead Dev, Community Manager)
- Fernanda (Lead, Developer)

## Technology stack
- React.js
- Gatsby.js
- Netlify (deployment)
- Airtable (embeddings)
- Google Domains (DNS)

## Syntax guidelines
- Basic linting format
- Spaces between “=” and one-lined “{}”
- Always use curly braces on if statements and loops
- Use comments, but not too much
- Follow [React.js best practices](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-best-practices/)
- Avoid using custom CSS, use the “theme-ui” properties/syntax instead
- Use the same coding-style as used currently
- If you are not sure if you should delete some code, just comment it out temporarily

## Developer workflow
- We use GitHub and Trello
- Co-Leads will assign tasks to developers
- All communication happens in the private “website-project” channel on CVT
- When working on the website, you can do any of the 3 things:
  - Work from an issue
  - Pick an issue
  - Make sure you assign yourself to the task
- Be sure to work on your own branch
  - You can pull requests with your own branch, you can’t push changes directly to the master
- Once you’re done, make a pull request
  - Doesn’t merge changes into master immediately
  - Also lets Netlify run checks before merge
  - One of the Co-Leads will look at your PR and merge it or tell you to make changes
- Testing the website
  - Go on our deployed website and test for any bugs
  - Not e2e/unit tests, just regular user tests
  - Any bugs that are found should be filed as an issue
    - Make sure you use the right tags!
    - Don’t assign anyone other than yourself

## Activity/time commitment
- There is no set number of hours you must work each day
- We expect you to constantly be working on tasks and helping improve the website most of the days of the week
- The website community manager (Calix) will oversee everyone’s progress and work
- Those who do not contribute up to the standard are in risk of being removed off of the website team
